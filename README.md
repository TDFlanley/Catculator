# Catculator

Welcome to my Catculator project! This is a playful calculator application I created using C++ and the .NET Framework. The Catculator allows you to perform various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and even calculations involving square and cube roots. While the name might be whimsical, the calculations are serious business!
